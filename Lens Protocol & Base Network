While Lens now operates on its own L2, its ethos and architecture align closely with the Base Network, Coinbase’s Ethereum Layer 2. Both platforms aim to onboard millions of users into Web3 by simplifying blockchain interactions.
Key Synergies:

User-Centric Design: Both Lens and Base prioritize user ownership and seamless onboarding.
Modular Infrastructure: Lens offers “Social Primitives” like profiles, feeds, and groups, which can be integrated into Base-powered dApps. [lens.xyz]
Developer Ecosystem: Builders on Base can leverage Lens’ open social graph to add social layers to DeFi, gaming, and commerce applications.

Though Lens runs on its own chain, its tools and primitives are interoperable with Base, enabling cross-chain social experiences.
