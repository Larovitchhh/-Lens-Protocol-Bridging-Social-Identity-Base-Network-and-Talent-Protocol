Talent Protocol is a Web3 platform focused on helping individuals build professional reputations and access career opportunities. Its integration with Lens Protocol creates a powerful synergy between social identity and work reputation.
Integration Highlights:

Social + Work Graphs: Users can display Lens-based social history alongside Talent Protocol’s work credentials.
Composable Modules: Builders can add freelance marketplaces to Lens apps or embed social feeds into TalentLayer-powered platforms.
Decentralized Identity: Both protocols support user-owned data, enabling portable profiles across platforms. [docs.talentlayer.org]

This collaboration fosters a new kind of professional network — one where users own their data, reputation, and connections.
